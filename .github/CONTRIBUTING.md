CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES FOR TTBP
================================

Hi! Thanks for your interest in working on this project with me!

Please understand that this may not be a beginner-friendly project to contribute
to; this is because I am not a very experienced developer, and I'm still
learning good practices for facilitating collaborative dev work. I'm open to
receiving feedback and discussion even if you're new to writing Python,
programming, or collaborative work in general, but I'd appreciate some extra
patience and slack.
