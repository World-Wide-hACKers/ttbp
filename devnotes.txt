NOTES FOR ~ENDO

handling global feels out of order:
  -check to see if entry filename date and mtime date matches
  -if not, process as if it was last modified on the date indicated by filename

stuff to sort out:

  -figure out how to deal with entries scrolling too far (either learn more
  curses handling, or find someone who knows how to do curses stuff)

  -there's like some seriously weird out of order updating for publishing that
  breaks things too much

user-friendliness:
  -reset button, instead of having to manually delete things
  -wall lock clearing
